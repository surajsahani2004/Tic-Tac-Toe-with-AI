🎮 X_&_O_with_Bot (Web Edition)
This is a modern, web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against a smart AI bot. I upgraded this project from a terminal-based script to a full web application to practice AI decision-making and Full-stack development.

✨ Features
Smart AI Opponent: The computer is programmed to play strategically. It will block your winning moves and try to win whenever possible.

Unpredictable Gameplay: Unlike basic bots, this AI uses a shuffle logic to ensure it doesn't play the exact same pattern every time, making the game more challenging.

Win Celebration: When you beat the bot, the screen celebrates with a colorful confetti 🎉 animation.

Clean Web UI: A professional 3x3 grid layout with a responsive "New Game" feature.

Error Prevention: The interface automatically disables occupied spots, so there are no invalid moves.

Backend: Python 3.13 (Flask Framework)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Dashboard UI)
